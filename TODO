  It seems the store is keyed on the application’s identity instead of the OAuth principles.
  In my case, I’m planning to access multiple user’s private data and would want to keep the
  codes/tokens keyed by UserID ( retrieved via https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
  permission scope )

TODO: RCL 2011-12-18 Agreed - the token_store is not very robust or flexible.  Should consider
implementing a token store which allows more generice storage (Cache::XXX family?)
