        Spec V2.15 / Google compatibility
        * Add scope param to Client
        * Always include grant_type param
        * Have POST request send params in body rather than URL query string
        * Allow user to specify name of access token query param in protected resource requests, 
          since Google calls it oauth_token rather than access_token.  This can be passed to the 
          client constructor as access_token_param => 'oauth_token'.
        * Changed the default access_token_method to POST from GET
        * Added a Google demo to the demo app that's included with the module package ( hosted at http://oauth2.kg23.com ).

        Add bearer_token_scheme parameter to support the various techniques in
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-02
        The default technique is now the authorization header (Authorization: OAuth <access_token>)
        Example values of this parameter:
        auth-header (default, same as auth-header:OAuth)
        auth-header:Bearer (custom scheme)
        auth-header:OAuth2 (custom scheme)
        uri-query (same as uri-query:oauth_token)
        uri-query:my_token_param (custom param name)
        form-body (same as form-body:oauth_token)
        form-body:my_token_param (custom param name)
